Required Modules
TensorFlow (with GPU support if you have a GPU)

For building and training the neural network.
bash
Copy code
->pip install tensorflow
NumPy

For numerical computations and array manipulations.
bash
Copy code
->pip install numpy
OpenCV

For image preprocessing and manipulation.
bash
Copy code
->pip install opencv-python
Scikit-learn

For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
bash
Copy code
->pip install scikit-learn
Flask (if you're deploying the model as a web app)

For creating the backend API.
bash
Copy code
->pip install flask
Matplotlib (optional)

For visualizing training progress (e.g., loss and accuracy plots).
bash
Copy code
->pip install matplotlib
For GPU Support
If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU, install the necessary dependencies:

TensorFlow GPU: TensorFlow already supports GPU acceleration by default. Ensure that the following are installed:

NVIDIA GPU Drivers: Download and install the latest drivers from the NVIDIA Drivers page.
CUDA Toolkit: Install from CUDA Toolkit Download.
cuDNN: Install from cuDNN Downloads.
Verify GPU Installation: Test if TensorFlow detects your GPU:

bash
Copy code
python -c "from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib; print(device_lib.list_local_devices())"
Combined Installation Command
To install everything at once, run:

bash
Copy code
->->pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python scikit-learn flask matplotlib
Verify Installation
Run the following Python script to ensure all modules are installed:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2
import sklearn
import flask
import matplotlib

print("All modules installed successfully!")
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
Let me know if you face any issues during installation!
